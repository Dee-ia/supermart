            <p>Trader Joe's Speculoos Cookie Butter (14.1 Oz Jar) Cookie Butter is, in the most simplistic terms, spreadable Speculoos cookies. 
            Speculoos cookies are classic Belgian cookies with great crunch, and a slightly caramelized, almost-but-not-quite-gingerbread flavor. 
            After the cookies are baked to a fabulous finish, they're crushed and mixed with vegetable oils and turned into a spread. 
            It resembles peanut butter in color and spreadability. The original Speculoos Cookie Butter is supremely smooth; Crunchy Cookie Butter is slightly crunchy, yet still supremely spreadable - kind of like the difference between creamy and crunchy peanut butter. 
            Trader Joe's Cookie Butter is Perfect on ice cream, toast, pancakes, sandwiches and as a treat for Kids of course.</p>
