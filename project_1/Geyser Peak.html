        <h2>Wine Tasting Notes</h2>
        <p>This singular and elegant wine reflects the characteristic depth of Bordeaux varieties and the winemaker's art in blending. 
        A beautiful violet-red color precedes inviting aromas of blackberry jam, fine cherry and rich mocha. The wine is luscious with subtle nuances of dark chocolate, smoky-mint, and vanilla cream. 
        The structure is softly complex with pliant tannins and a succulent finish. Pairs well with braised lamb shanks, seared flank steak, and aged cheddar.</p>

        <p>62% Cabernet Sauvignon, 18% Malbec, 10% Cabernet Franc, 10% Merlot, Alcohol 14.2%</p>
