        <p>Engineered for ultimate comfort, the Circuit is stylistically sharp, super sticky, and ultra-durable, making for a performance lifestyle shoe thatâ€™s equally at home at the gym, crag, or bar. 
        Featuring a breathable knit upper for temperature control and a low-rise, collapsible heal that can easily flip down for a slip-on feel, the Circuit can also handle approaches thanks to its BlackLabel-Street sticky rubber outsole. 
        Rubber toe protection adds security, and the webbing loops allow for various tagging and stowing options for when the trail ends and the climbing begins.</p>
