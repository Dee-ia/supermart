        <p>Passion fruit juice is a beverage that is made from the pulp and/or the seeds of the Passiflora plant. Passion fruit is technically a berry and comes in three different varieties: 
        purple passion fruit, yellow passion fruit, and giant passion fruit. You can buy commercially-prepared passion fruit juice cocktail in the store, but youâ€™ll gain greater health benefits if you prepare your own passion fruit juice at home.</p>

        <h2>Carbs in Passion Fruit Juice</h2>
        <p>The calories in passion fruit juice come almost entirely from carbohydrate. But the number of carbs in passion fruit juice will depend on the brand that you buy or the recipe that you use to make it. Many commercially prepared passion fruit drinks are actually blends made from several different types of juice.
        For example, Welch's brand Passion Fruit Refrigerated Juice Cocktail is a blend of grape, apple, and passion fruit juices. The juice also includes high fructose corn syrup (an added sugar) and other ingredients.
        An 8-ounce serving of this juice provides 140 calories and 34 grams of sugar. But cold-pressed passion fruit juice made with no extra ingredients provides 60 calories per 12-ounce serving and only 13 grams of carbohydrate.
        The estimated glycemic load (GL) of passion fruit juice is 13. Glycemic load is an estimated glycemic index that takes into account the serving size of a give food or beverage.
        It is considered to be more helpful than just using glycemic index for people who are choosing foods based on their effects on blood glucose.</p>

        <h2>Fats in Passion Fruit Juice</h2>
        <p>There is no fat in passion fruit juice. Passion fruit contains less than one gram of polyunsaturated fat. The only way that a passion fruit recipe would provide any fat is if the ingredients included a fatty liquid, such as coconut milk.</p>

        <h2>Protein in Passion Fruit Juice</h2>
        <p>There may be up to one gram of protein in passion fruit juice if the serving size is twelve ounces. But most varieties of passion fruit juice that you make at home or buy in the stores will contain zero grams of protein.</p>

        <h2>Micronutrients in Passion Fruit Juice</h2>
        <p>Whole fresh passion fruit contains small amounts of certain vitamins and minerals. For example, a whole raw passion fruit contributes 5 mg of vitamin C, or 7 percent of your total recommended daily intake if you consume a 2,000 calorie per day diet. 
        You'll also benefit from getting 2 percent of your recommended daily intake of riboflavin, iron, magnesium, phosphorus, vitamin A, and phosphorus.</p>

        <p>When you drink passion fruit juice, however, your intake of the vitamins and minerals will most likely increase because you are consuming the juice of more than one fruit.
        For example, some commercially prepared brands of raw passion fruit juice claim that you'll benefit from 15-50 percent of your daily intake of vitamin A and 30 to 80 percent of your daily intake of vitamin C.
        If you purchase a commercially-prepared passion fruit juice cocktail, your vitamin intake may be even higher since the juice is blended with the juice of other fruits.</p>

        <h2>Health Benefits</h2>
        <p>Fans of passion fruit juice say that drinking the beverage can provide several health and beauty benefits.
        For example, vitamin C (L-ascorbic acid) is essential for good bone structure, cartilage, muscle, and blood vessels.
        It also aids in the absorption of iron and promotes wound healing.
        According to the National Institutes of Health, "ongoing research is examining whether vitamin C, by limiting the damaging effects of free radicals through its antioxidant activity, might help prevent or delay the development of certain cancers, cardiovascular disease, and other diseases in which oxidative stress plays a causal role."</p>
        <p>Vitamin C must be consumed in the diet because our bodies are unable to make it. The amount of vitamin C in the passion fruit juice you consume will vary based on how it is made, but you may get up to 80 percent of your recommended daily intake.
        You'll also get a healthy boost of vitamin A when you consume passion fruit juice. Vitamin A is essential for healthy hair, skin, and mucous membranes in the body. It is essential for bone and tooth health and is also important for normal vision and a healthy immune system.</p>
